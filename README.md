# mini_tester


THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR EVALS OR REAL TESTING,
THIS IS PURELY A QUICKER WAY TO RUN TESTS.
- DO NOT FAIL SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY FAILED THIS
- DO NOT PASS SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY PASSED THIS
- DO YOUR OWN TESTING, DO NOT BE A SHEEP.

USAGE 

Clone this into root of repo
"bash unit_tester.sh <file_with_tests>"
